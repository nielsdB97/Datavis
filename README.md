## Eindopdracht

## 0. Clone the repository

With [git][], do:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nielsdB97/Datavis.git
```

**Or, click the big green button “Clone or download” and
install from there. Don’t forget to `cd` into the directory.**

## 1. Get the data

Since we're using data from a specific Google Sheet, it's nice to always know we have the most up-to-date version.
To get the latest data, run:

```sh
make download
```

## 2. Visit index.html

Because of XSS vulnerabilities, most browser won't allow you to view it locally.
Either set up a local HTTP server or put the files on a web server to view the result.

**It's also [live][]**
